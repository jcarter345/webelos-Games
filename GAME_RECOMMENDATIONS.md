## New Game Concepts

These are entirely new game types that would expand the site beyond Jeopardy and the Walkabout.

---

### 7. Rock & Mineral Identifier

**Adventure:** Earth Rocks! (Elective)

**Game Type:** Matching / Classification Game

**How It Works:**
- Scouts are shown images of rocks and minerals
- They must classify each as sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic
- A "Mohs Scale Challenge" round: given two minerals, predict which scratches which
- Drag rocks into the correct stage of the Rock Cycle diagram
- Bonus: "Crystal Lab" — grow virtual crystals by selecting correct conditions

**Educational Value:** Directly covers requirements 1 (examine 3 rock types) and 3 (Mohs scale testing). Makes abstract geology concepts visual and hands-on.

---

### 8. GPS Navigator

**Adventure:** Tech on the Trail (Elective)

**Game Type:** Navigation / Puzzle Game

**How It Works:**
- A top-down trail map with waypoints and landmarks
- Scouts use compass directions (N, S, E, W, NE, etc.) to navigate between points
- GPS coordinate challenges: given coordinates, find the location on the map
- Plan a 2-mile route that hits all required checkpoints while avoiding hazards
- Teach latitude/longitude basics through progressive levels

**Educational Value:** Covers requirements 2 (explore GPS) and 3 (plan a 2-mile trek with mapping tools). Makes GPS concepts interactive rather than theoretical.

---

### 9. Math Hike Calculator

**Adventure:** Math on the Trail (Elective)

**Game Type:** Math Puzzle / Estimation Game

**How It Works:**
- **Pace Calculator:** Scout enters steps for a quarter-mile, game calculates pace
- **Distance Estimator:** Given a pace, estimate how long trails of various lengths will take
- **Trail Planner:** Plan a 20-mile, 2-day hike — factor in terrain (uphill = slower), rest breaks, daylight hours, and weather
- **Quick Math Rounds:** Word problems set on the trail — "If you drink 1 liter per 3 miles and the trail is 8 miles..."

**Educational Value:** Directly maps to all 3 requirements: determine pace (req 1), project 2-mile time (req 2), and project 20-mile hike with factors (req 3). Turns math into adventure planning.

---

### 10. Pinewood Derby Physics Lab

**Adventure:** Race Time (Elective)

**Game Type:** Design & Simulation Game

**How It Works:**
- **Car Designer:** Adjust weight placement, wheel alignment, and body shape
- **Friction Explorer:** Test different wheel lubricants and axle types to see speed impact
- **Race Simulator:** Watch your designed car race down the track against AI opponents
- **Science Explainer:** After each race, see why your design was fast or slow (center of gravity, friction coefficient, aerodynamics)
- Teaches good sportsmanship with a post-race debrief

**Educational Value:** Covers requirements 3 (friction properties) and 5 (race participation) conceptually. Lets scouts experiment with physics before building their real car.

---

### 11. Knot Tying Trainer

**Adventure:** Let's Camp (Elective), Catch the Big One (Elective)

**Game Type:** Interactive Step-by-Step Tutorial + Quiz

**How It Works:**
- Animated step-by-step diagrams for each knot: bowline, square knot, taut-line hitch, clove hitch, two half hitches
- "When Would You Use This?" — scenario cards that ask which knot to tie (securing a tent? tying a fishing hook? hanging a bear bag?)
- Speed challenge: identify the knot from a picture as fast as possible
- Progressive difficulty: watch the animation → arrange the steps in order → identify from a photo

**Educational Value:** Let's Camp requirement 4 (tie a bowline, explain when to use it). Catch the Big One requirement 5 (best knot for hook to line). Knots are a core scouting skill used across multiple adventures.

---

### 12. Campfire Builder

**Adventure:** Let's Camp (Elective)

**Game Type:** Drag-and-Drop Simulation

**How It Works:**
- **Fire Safety Check:** Identify a safe location (clear area, away from tents, check wind direction)
- **Gather Materials:** Sort items into tinder, kindling, and fuel wood categories
- **Build the Fire Lay:** Drag and stack materials to build a proper teepee fire lay
- **Light It Up:** Follow the correct sequence to safely light and maintain the fire
- **Put It Out:** Demonstrate the "drown, stir, feel" method to fully extinguish

**Educational Value:** Covers Let's Camp requirement 5 (fire safety rules, teepee fire lay, safe lighting). Fire building is one of the most anticipated scout skills — a simulator lets them practice the logic before doing it for real.

---

### 13. Hazard House

**Adventure:** My Safety (Required — Personal Safety)

**Game Type:** Hidden Object / Point-and-Click Game

**How It Works:**
- A detailed illustration of a house with rooms (kitchen, garage, bathroom, bedroom)
- Scouts click to find improperly stored hazardous items (cleaning supplies, medications, sharp objects, chemicals)
- For each item found, show the warning label and what to do if exposed
- Bonus round: identify safety improvements (smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, escape routes)
- Score based on items found and correct storage solutions

**Educational Value:** Directly covers My Safety requirements 2 (identify hazardous items, check storage, read labels) and 3 (ways to keep home safe). Makes home safety inspection into a detective game.

---

### 14. Accessibility Challenge

**Adventure:** Aware and Care (Elective)

**Game Type:** Perspective / Simulation Game

**How It Works:**
- **Visual Impairment Round:** Navigate a familiar environment with blurred/limited vision; complete tasks using audio cues only
- **Hearing Impairment Round:** Watch a video/animation with no sound and answer questions — experience relying on visual cues and captions
- **Mobility Round:** Plan a route through a building, but certain paths are blocked (no ramps, narrow doorways) — find accessible alternatives
- **Reflection:** After each round, discuss what was hard and how barriers can be removed

**Educational Value:** Covers requirements 1 (visual impairment activity), 2 (hearing impairment activity), and 3 (explore barriers to access). Builds empathy through first-person experience in a respectful, educational way.

---

### Adventures Without Game Recommendations

Some adventures are primarily physical, hands-on, or personal in nature, making them less suited for screen-based games:

- **My Family** — Faith traditions and family activities are personal and vary widely
- **Art Explosion** — Drawing, painting, and digital art are best done with real materials
- **Build It** — Carpentry requires physical tools and wood
- **Paddle Onward** — Water-based paddling skills need real water
- **Summertime Fun** — Participation in 3 summer activities
- **Yo-Yo** — Physical dexterity skill best learned with a real yo-yo

These adventures are better supported with printable resources or video tutorials rather than interactive games.
